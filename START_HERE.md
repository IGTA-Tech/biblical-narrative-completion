## ✅ Your First Quality Check (10 minutes)

python quality_checker.py --section "Proverbs"

# Look at the score:
# - 97-100: Perfect! Commit it.

# - Below 93: Review feedback, enhance weak areas.
```

**If score < 97:** Look at the feedback and fix issues.

Common fixes:

## 🆘 If You Get Stuck

### Problem: Quality score too low

**Solution:** 99% of the time, add more archaeological detail.

Example fix:
```
BEFORE:
"Proverbs reflects ancient wisdom traditions."

AFTER:
"Proverbs reflects ancient Near Eastern wisdom traditions evidenced by parallels with Egyptian Instruction of Amenemope (c. 11th century BCE), Mesopotamian wisdom texts from the Old Babylonian period, and Ugaritic wisdom literature from Ras Shamra (14th-13th centuries BCE). Dead Sea Scrolls fragments (4QProverbs) preserve portions of Proverbs..."
```

### Problem: Don't know what to write

**Solution:** Copy the structure from a completed section.

Open Joshua 1-5 or Psalms 1-5 and use it as a template.

### Problem: Taking too long

**Solution:**
1. Set a 2-hour timer
2. Write whatever you can in that time
3. Run quality checker
4. Spend 30 minutes fixing issues
5. Commit even if not perfect
6. Return tomorrow to enhance

Progress > Perfection

### Problem: Can't find archaeological sources

**Resources:**
- https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org (Bible Archaeology Review)
- https://biblearchaeology.org (Associates for Biblical Research)
- https://www.blueletterbible.org (Blue Letter Bible)
- Search "[book name] archaeology" on Google Scholar
