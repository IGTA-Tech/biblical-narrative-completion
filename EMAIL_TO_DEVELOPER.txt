Subject: Easy Background Job - $375 for Copy/Paste Work Using Claude Code

Hi [Developer Name],

I have an easy project that's perfect for running in the background while you work on other things. It's basically a copy/paste job using Claude Code - very straightforward.

=== THE JOB ===

Complete a Biblical narrative document from 53.8% to 100% using automated tools and AI.

Your workflow:
1. Copy prompt from template
2. Paste into Claude Code
3. Let Claude write the content (10-15 min while you do other work)
4. Run automated quality checker (1 command)
5. Copy result into document
6. Commit to GitHub
7. Repeat

That's it! The AI does the writing, the scripts do the quality checking. You just manage the process.

=== PAYMENT ===

$375 TOTAL (5 payments):

• $75 DEPOSIT - Paid immediately when you accept the job
• $75 - After completing 25% of remaining work (~28 sections)
• $75 - After completing 50% of remaining work (~55 sections)
• $75 - After completing 75% of remaining work (~83 sections)
• $75 - After completing 100% (all 111 sections done)

=== WHY THIS IS EASY ===

✅ Everything is already set up and documented
✅ Claude Code does all the actual writing
✅ Automated scripts check quality (tells you if it's good enough)
✅ Clear templates and copy/paste prompts ready
✅ 129/240 sections already done (you just finish the rest)
✅ Examples showing exactly what A+ quality looks like
✅ Runs in background - work on other projects while Claude processes

Repository with everything ready:
https://github.com/IGTA-Tech/biblical-narrative-completion

=== WHAT YOU NEED ===

✓ Can use Claude Code (or any AI coding assistant) - FREE
✓ Can run Python scripts (quality_checker.py, progress_tracker.py)
✓ Can use Git (basic: add, commit, push)
✓ Can follow step-by-step instructions

You DON'T need:
✗ Biblical knowledge (Claude handles content)
✗ Writing skills (Claude writes everything)
✗ Research skills (Claude does research)

=== TYPICAL SECTION (15-20 min active time) ===

1. Copy prompt (30 sec)
2. Paste to Claude Code (30 sec)
3. Wait for Claude to write (10-15 min) ← DO OTHER WORK DURING THIS
4. Run quality checker (2 min)
5. If score < 97, ask Claude to enhance (5 min)
6. Copy result to document (1 min)
7. Commit to GitHub (1 min)

111 sections remaining × 20 minutes each = Background work you can do alongside other projects

=== QUALITY CONTROL (AUTOMATED) ===

One command tells you if the work is ready:

$ python3 quality_checker.py --section "Proverbs"
Score: 98/100 (A+) ✅ Ready to commit!

If score is low, it tells you exactly what to fix. You paste that to Claude, and it fixes automatically.

No guesswork!
